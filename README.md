### Amazon_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
#### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews of Amazon Electronics products for sentiment analysis and insights into product ratings. The dataset contains 5.5 lakh rows, with fields like ProductId, UserId, ProfileName, Helpfulness, Score, Time, Summary, and Text. The primary goals are:

Analyze the Score: Understand the distribution of product ratings.
Sentiment Analysis: Process and clean the Summary and Text columns to derive sentiment insights.
Features of the Project
Data Cleaning: Combines Summary and Text columns, removes special characters, and eliminates stopwords.
Sentiment Analysis: Prepares cleaned text data for further analysis or modeling.
Optimized Processing: Handles large datasets efficiently using techniques like parallel processing, vectorized operations, and batch processing.
Free Tools Only: Avoids paid APIs for analysis.
Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

####
pandas (for data manipulation)
nltk (for natural language processing)
re (for regular expression-based cleaning)
pandarallel (optional, for parallel processing)
matplotlib and seaborn (for visualizations)
Install dependencies via pip:

####
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas nltk matplotlib seaborn pandarallel
Project Workflow
Dataset Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

####
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('amazon_reviews.csv')
Data Preprocessing: Combine Summary and Text columns and clean the text:

####
python
Copy code
df['combined_text'] = df['Summary'].fillna('') + ' ' + df['Text'].fillna('')
Optimized Text Cleaning:

####
Use vectorized operations for preprocessing.
Optional: Implement parallel or batch processing for large datasets.
python
Copy code
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
df['cleaned_text'] = (
    df['combined_text']
    .str.replace(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', regex=True)
    .str.lower()
    .str.split()
    .apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x if word not in stop_words]))
)
Sentiment Analysis: Prepare the cleaned data for further sentiment analysis or modeling using machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or deep learning.

Visualization: Analyze the Score distribution and visualize insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

Performance Optimization Tips
Use pandarallel for parallelized cleaning:

python
Copy code
from pandarallel import pandarallel
pandarallel.initialize(progress_bar=True)
df['cleaned_text'] = df['combined_text'].parallel_apply(clean_text)
Process in smaller batches:

python
Copy code
chunk_size = 50000
chunks = [df[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, df.shape[0], chunk_size)]
processed_chunks = [process_chunk(chunk) for chunk in chunks]
df = pd.concat(processed_chunks, ignore_index=True)
Future Enhancements
Implement advanced models like BERT for sentiment classification.
Use topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to understand major themes in the reviews.
Visualize relationships between scores and sentiments using dashboards (e.g., Tableau or Power BI).
How to Run
Clone the repository or download the script.
Install the required Python libraries.
Place the amazon_reviews.csv dataset in the project directory.
Run the script to preprocess and analyze the data:
bash
